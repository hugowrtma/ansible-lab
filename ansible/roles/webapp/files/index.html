            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>Formed in New York City in 1998, The Strokes emerged as the vanguard of the garage rock revival that would define the early 2000s. Childhood friends Julian Casablancas and Nick Valensi were soon joined by Nikolai Fraiture, Fabrizio Moretti, and Albert Hammond Jr., creating a lineup that would change the face of rock music.</p>
                
                <p>Their 2001 debut album, <em>Is This It</em>, arrived like a shot of adrenaline to a stagnant rock scene. With its raw production, tight songwriting, and effortlessly cool aesthetic, the album became one of the most influential records of the 21st century. Critics hailed it as a masterpiece, and it inspired countless bands to pick up guitars again.</p>
                
                <p>The band's sound—a blend of punk energy, new wave grooves, and Lou Reed-style deadpan vocals—felt both nostalgic and revolutionary. Songs like "Last Nite," "Someday," and "Hard to Explain" became anthems for a generation seeking authenticity in an increasingly manufactured pop landscape.</p>
                
                <p>Over the years, The Strokes have continued to evolve, releasing six studio albums and maintaining their status as one of rock's most important bands. Despite tensions, lineup changes, and the inevitable challenges of longevity, they've remained vital, proving that their initial spark wasn't just a flash in the pan.</p>
